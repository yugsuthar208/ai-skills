# Brooks-Lint — PR Review
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need pR code review that surfaces decay risks, design smells, and maintainability issues with concrete Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy findings, drawing on twelve classic engineering books. Triggers when: user asks to review code, check a PR, shares a diff or pastes code asking...


## Setup

1. Read `../_shared/common.md` for the Iron Law, Project Config, Report Template, and Health Score rules
2. Read `../_shared/source-coverage.md` for book-level coverage, exceptions, and tradeoffs
3. Read `../_shared/decay-risks.md` for symptom definitions and source attributions
4. Read `pr-review-guide.md` in this directory for the analysis process

## Process

**If the user has not specified files or pasted code:** apply Auto Scope Detection
from `../_shared/common.md` to determine the review scope before proceeding.

1. Understand the review scope, then scan for each decay risk in the order specified (Steps 1–6 of the guide)
2. Run the Quick Test Check (Step 7 of the guide) — skip for docs-only or non-production changes
3. Apply the Iron Law to every finding
4. Output using the Report Template from common.md

**Mode line in report:** `PR Review`

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
