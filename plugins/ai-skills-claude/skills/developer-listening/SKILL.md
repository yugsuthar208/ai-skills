# Developer Listening
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need monitor what developers say about your brand, competitors, and the problems they're solving. Track mentions and conversations across GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Twitter, and Discord. Trigger phrases: "developer listening", "monitor developer conversations", "track...


Monitor developer conversations across platforms to understand sentiment, find engagement opportunities, and gather competitive intelligence.

## Overview

Developer listening is the practice of systematically monitoring what developers say about your brand, competitors, and the problems your product solves. Unlike traditional social listening, developer listening requires monitoring technical platforms where developers actually spend time: GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit programming communities, Stack Overflow, Twitter/X, and Discord servers.

Effective developer listening helps you:
- Understand how developers perceive your product
- Find frustrated users who need help (and might churn)
- Discover engagement opportunities before competitors
- Gather unfiltered product feedback
- Track competitive positioning in real conversations
- Identify content gaps and documentation issues

## Setting Up Your Monitoring Strategy

### 1. Define Your Keyword Categories

Before setting up monitoring, organize keywords into categories:

**Brand Keywords:**
- Your product name and common misspellings
- Your company name
- Key team members' names (for attribution)
- Your GitHub org/repos
- Your Twitter handles

**Competitor Keywords:**
- Direct competitor names
- Competitor product features
- Competitor pricing/plan names

**Problem Keywords:**
- Pain points your product solves
- Error messages you help with
- Workflow descriptions ("deploy to kubernetes", "manage API keys")
- "How do I..." phrases relevant to your space

**Buy Intent Keywords:**
- "[category] recommendation"
- "best [tool type] for [use case]"
- "looking for [solution]"
- "alternative to [competitor]"
- "[competitor] vs"

### 2. Set Up Monitoring Tools

Choose a social listening tool that aggregates mentions across developer platforms (GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Twitter).

**Recommended Keyword Structure:**
- Create separate keywords for brand, competitors, and problem spaces
- Use exact match for brand names to reduce noise
- Use broader matching for problem keywords
- Set up negative keywords to filter irrelevant mentions

### 3. Platform-Specific Monitoring

**GitHub:**
- Monitor issues mentioning your product in other repos
- Track discussions in relevant GitHub Discussions
- Watch for your product in awesome-lists and comparison repos
- Monitor stars/forks of competitor repos for traction signals

**Hacker News:**
- High-signal but low-volume
- Comments often contain detailed technical feedback
- "Show HN" and "Ask HN" posts reveal developer needs
- Threads about competitors are engagement opportunities

**Reddit:**
- r/programming, r/webdev, r/devops, r/selfhosted, etc.
- Subreddit-specific cultures require tailored responses
- Question threads are high-intent opportunities

**Stack Overflow:**
- Monitor tags related to your product category
- Questions reveal documentation gaps
- Answers from competitors show their positioning

**Twitter/X:**
- Real-time sentiment and virality
- Developer influencer conversations
- Conference and event discussions
- Complaint threads often go viral

**Discord:**
- Harder to monitor but high-signal
- Join relevant community servers manually
- Look for integration opportunities with popular servers

## Sentiment Analysis and Prioritization

### Prioritization Framework

Not all mentions deserve equal attention. Prioritize based on:

**High Priority (Respond within hours):**
- Negative sentiment from existing users
- Direct questions about your product
- Complaints going viral
- Competitor comparisons where you're losing
- Buy-intent signals from ideal customer profiles

**Medium Priority (Respond within 24-48 hours):**
- Neutral mentions seeking recommendations
- Feature requests in public forums
- Documentation confusion
- Competitor criticism (potential switchers)

**Low Priority (Monitor and aggregate):**
- General industry discussions
- Competitor praise (learn from it)
- Historical mentions for trend analysis

### Sentiment Filtering

Most monitoring tools offer sentiment filtering. Key queries to set up:

- Negative sentiment mentions from the last 30 days
- High-relevance mentions that haven't been engaged with yet
- Platform-specific filters (Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter)

## Finding Engagement Opportunities

### Types of Engagement Opportunities

**Frustrated Users:**
- Complaining about your product = urgent support opportunity
- Complaining about competitors = potential conversion
- Complaining about the problem space = thought leadership opportunity

**Questions and Recommendations:**
- Direct questions about your product
- "What tool should I use for X" threads
- Comparison requests

**Buy Intent Signals:**
- "Looking for a [your category]"
- "Evaluating [competitor] vs [competitor]"
- "Need to migrate from [competitor]"
- "Budget approved for [solution]"

### Engagement Best Practices

1. **Be helpful first, promotional second** - Answer the question before mentioning your product
2. **Disclose affiliation** - "I work at [company]" builds trust
3. **Match the platform culture** - HN hates marketing speak, Reddit values authenticity
4. **Provide value even if they don't convert** - Good advice builds reputation
5. **Don't argue with critics** - Acknowledge, fix if valid, move on

## Competitive Intelligence from Conversations

### What to Track

**Competitor Mentions:**
- Praise (what are they doing right?)
- Criticism (opportunities for you)
- Feature requests (what's missing?)
- Churn signals ("migrating away from")

**Positioning Shifts:**
- How competitors describe themselves
- Which use cases they emphasize
- Pricing and packaging discussions

**Community Sentiment:**
- Overall vibe toward competitors
- Developer trust levels
- Support quality perception

### Extracting Insights

Track trends over time using your monitoring tool's analytics:

- Sentiment trends for competitors over 90 days
- Mention volume comparison between your brand and top competitors
- Platform breakdown (where are conversations happening?)

## Tools

### Social Listening

Use a monitoring tool that tracks developer platforms. Key capabilities to look for:
- Multi-platform coverage (GitHub, HN, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Twitter)
- Sentiment analysis
- Keyword alerts and filtering
- Analytics and trend tracking

### Platform-Specific Tools

**GitHub Search:**
- Use `gh search issues` and `gh search repos` for GitHub-specific monitoring
- Track issues mentioning your product in other repositories

**Twitter/X Search:**
- Advanced search operators for precise monitoring
- Track specific accounts and hashtags
- Tools like Typefully, TweetDeck, or Hootsuite for monitoring

**Reddit:**
- Native Reddit search with subreddit filters
- Third-party tools like Syften or F5Bot for alerts

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
