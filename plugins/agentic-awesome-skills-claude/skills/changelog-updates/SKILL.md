# Changelogs and Product Updates Developers Care About
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need create release notes and product updates that developers actually read and care about. This skill covers changelog formatting, versioning communication, breaking change announcements, deprecation notices, and building anticipation for new features. Trigger phrases: "changelog",...


Release notes are developer communication, not documentation. When done well, they build trust, demonstrate momentum, and turn updates into marketing moments.

## Overview

Changelogs serve multiple audiences and purposes:
- **Active developers**: "What changed that affects my integration?"
- **Evaluating developers**: "Is this product actively maintained?"
- **Developer advocates**: "What's worth sharing with my audience?"
- **Your team**: Historical record of what shipped and when

This skill covers creating changelogs that inform, build trust, and occasionally delight.

## Before You Start

Review the **developer-audience-context** skill to understand:
- How do your developers prefer to receive updates?
- What changes do they care most about?
- How much detail do they need?
- What's their tolerance for breaking changes?

Your changelog tone and detail level should match your audience.

## Versioning Communication

### Semantic Versioning Explained to Users

Help developers understand what version numbers mean:

```markdown
# Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major versions (3.0.0)**: May include breaking changes.
  Check the migration guide before upgrading.

- **Minor versions (2.3.0)**: New features, backward compatible.
  Safe to upgrade.

- **Patch versions (2.3.1)**: Bug fixes only.
  Always safe to upgrade.
```

### Version Pinning Guidance

Help developers make good choices:

```markdown
# Recommended Version Constraints

For stability, we recommend:
- `"myapi": "^2.3.0"` - Get patches and minor updates
- `"myapi": "~2.3.0"` - Get patches only

For production systems:
- Pin exact versions: `"myapi": "2.3.0"`
- Review changelogs before upgrading
- Test in staging first
```

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
