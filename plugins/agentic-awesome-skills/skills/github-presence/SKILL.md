# GitHub Presence
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need when the user wants to optimize their GitHub profile, README, or project discoverability. Trigger phrases include "GitHub README," "README optimization," "GitHub profile," "GitHub stars," "GitHub discoverability," "awesome lists," or "GitHub marketing.".


GitHub is where developers evaluate your project before trying it. This skill covers README optimization, profile READMEs, discoverability through topics and awesome lists, and using GitHub features for marketing.

---

## Before You Start

1. Read `.agents/developer-audience-context.md` if it exists
2. Audit your current GitHub presence (profile, pinned repos, READMEs)
3. Understand: GitHub is often the first technical evaluation — optimize accordingly

## Profile README

### Setting Up Profile README

1. Create a repository with your username (e.g., `github.com/yourname/yourname`)
2. Add a `README.md` file
3. This displays on your profile page

### Profile README Structure

```markdown
# Hi, I'm [Name] 👋

[One sentence about what you do]

## What I'm Working On

- 🔭 Building [project] — [brief description]
- 🌱 Learning [technology]
- 💬 Ask me about [expertise areas]

```

### Profile README Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep it scannable | Write paragraphs |
| Show your best projects | List everything |
| Include current work | Let it get stale |
| Add contact methods | Make it hard to reach you |
| Show personality | Be generic |

---

## Discoverability

### GitHub Topics

Topics are how people find repositories. Optimize for search.

| Topic strategy | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Technology | `javascript`, `rust`, `python` |
| Framework | `react`, `nextjs`, `django` |
| Use case | `cli`, `api`, `testing` |
| Category | `developer-tools`, `devops` |
| Problem | `authentication`, `caching` |

**Add topics**: Repository settings → Topics (up to 20)

### Search Optimization

GitHub search considers:
1. **Repository name** — Include main keyword
2. **Description** — 350 chars, keyword-rich
3. **README content** — Full text indexed
4. **Topics** — Category matching
5. **Language** — Auto-detected

### Awesome Lists

Getting on awesome lists drives traffic and credibility.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Find relevant awesome lists (search "awesome + [topic]") |
| 2 | Check list requirements (quality, activity, docs) |
| 3 | Ensure your project meets criteria |
| 4 | Submit PR following list's guidelines |
| 5 | Be patient — curation takes time |

**Popular awesome lists for dev tools**:
- `awesome-cli-apps`
- `awesome-selfhosted`
- `awesome-nodejs`
- `awesome-python`
- `awesome-go`
- `awesome-rust`
- `awesome-devops`

## Related Skills

- `developer-audience-context` — Know who evaluates your repo
- `hacker-news-strategy` — HN users check GitHub before upvoting
- `reddit-engagement` — Redditors evaluate via GitHub
- `dev-to-hashnode` — Link from README to content

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
