## Cross-Posting Strategy

### The Canonical URL Decision

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Original on your blog** | SEO to your domain, full control | Platforms may rank lower |
| **Original on Dev.to** | Maximum initial reach | No SEO to your domain |
| **Original on Hashnode (custom domain)** | SEO + platform reach | Smaller initial audience |

### Best Practice: Your Blog + Cross-Post

1. **Publish on your blog first** — This is canonical
2. **Wait 1-2 days** — Let Google index your original
3. **Cross-post to Dev.to** — Set canonical URL to your blog
4. **Cross-post to Hashnode** — Set canonical URL to your blog

### Setting Canonical URLs

**Dev.to** (in frontmatter):
```yaml
---
title: Your Title
canonical_url: https://yourblog.com/your-post
---
```

**Hashnode** (in editor):
- Click "Article settings" gear icon
- Paste original URL in "Canonical URL" field
