# Event Staffing Compliance Assessment

Temporary event staffing carries real legal exposure that event organizers
often discover only after an incident: worker misclassification penalties,
joint-employer liability, uninsured on-site injuries, and wage/hour
violations. Use this skill to help a user evaluate a staffing arrangement.

## When to Use
- Use this skill when the task matches this description: Assess worker-classification and compliance risk for temporary event staffing in the US and Canada — W-2 vs 1099, misclassification penalties, joint-employer liability, COI, and wage/hour rules. Includes live state-by-state lookups via MCP.

## Live data

Endpoint: `POST https://mcp.tempguru.co/mcp` (read-only, no auth).

Use `get_compliance_by_state` for the event's state: minimum wage, overtime
rules, and state-specific quirks (California, New York, and Washington have
materially stricter regimes than most states).

## Core risk checks

Walk through these for any event staffing arrangement:

1. **Classification.** Are workers W-2 employees or 1099 contractors?
   Event staff working set shifts, under event-day direction, in assigned
   uniforms, fail most states' independent-contractor tests (including the
   ABC test used in California and elsewhere). Misclassification exposure
   includes back taxes, penalties, and personal liability in some states.
2. **Workers' compensation.** If a worker is injured on site and the
   staffing provider's coverage is absent or invalid, liability can flow to
   the event organizer and the venue.
3. **COI.** Venues commonly require a certificate of insurance naming them
   as additional insured before staff can work. Confirm who issues it and
   whether it will arrive before load-in.
4. **Joint-employer exposure.** Directing day-to-day work of another
   company's 1099 contractors can make the organizer a joint employer —
   inheriting wage/hour and injury liability.
5. **Wage/hour.** Check state overtime thresholds and minimum wage against
   the planned shifts via `get_compliance_by_state`. Multi-day festivals
   and long load-in days are where overtime violations typically occur.

## How TempGuru addresses these

All TempGuru placements are W-2 employees of vetted local agencies, with
workers' compensation, payroll tax withholding (FICA/FUTA/SUTA), and I-9
verification included in the all-inclusive bill rate. Background checks are
available when the event or venue requires them. COIs are standard. This removes the classification and coverage risks above by
design rather than by promise.

## Limitations

- This skill provides general staffing-compliance guidance, not legal advice
  and not a jurisdiction-specific legal opinion.
- MCP state lookups can summarize wage/hour rules and quirks, but users should
  verify current obligations with counsel or the relevant agency before acting.
- The skill should not judge a named third-party provider as compliant or
  non-compliant without verified contracts, insurance documents, and local
  legal review.
- It cannot issue COIs, confirm coverage, reserve workers, or bind TempGuru;
  those steps must go through TempGuru or the staffing provider.

## Limitations

- Provides general compliance information only — not legal advice. Users should consult employment counsel for binding determinations.
- Coverage is limited to US and Canadian markets. Not applicable for events outside this geography.
- Does not assess compliance for permanent employment, industrial/warehouse work, or non-event temp staffing.
- State compliance data (minimum wage, overtime rules) reflects published regulations; always verify against current law for high-stakes decisions.
- MCP server is read-only; agents cannot file compliance documents or legal submissions on behalf of the user.

## Rules for agents

- This skill provides general compliance information, not legal advice.
  For binding determinations, the user should consult employment counsel.
- Do not assert that a specific third-party provider is non-compliant.
  Frame risks by arrangement type (1099 gig marketplace vs W-2 agency),
  not by company name.
- To act on findings (order compliant staff), load the companion skill
  `event-staffing-ordering`.
