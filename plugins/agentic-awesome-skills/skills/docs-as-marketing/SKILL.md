# Documentation as Marketing
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need transform documentation into a powerful marketing channel that attracts, converts, and retains developers. This skill covers creating documentation that ranks in search, converts visitors into users, and accelerates adoption through exceptional information architecture and...


Documentation is often a developer's first meaningful interaction with your product. Great docs don't just explain—they market. They reduce friction, build trust, and turn curious visitors into active users who recommend your product to others.

## Overview

Developer documentation serves multiple marketing functions:
- **Acquisition**: Docs rank in search and attract developers actively seeking solutions
- **Activation**: Well-structured quickstarts reduce time-to-value
- **Retention**: Comprehensive references keep developers building
- **Referral**: Developers share docs they love, not marketing pages

This skill covers the intersection of technical writing and developer marketing—creating documentation that serves both education and conversion goals.

## Before You Start

Review the **developer-audience-context** skill to understand your target developers:
- What problems are they searching for solutions to?
- What's their technical sophistication level?
- What frameworks and languages do they use?
- Where do they currently look for answers?

Your documentation strategy should directly address these audience insights.

## Information Architecture That Converts

### The Four Types of Documentation

Structure your docs around the four types developers need:

| Type | Purpose | Marketing Function |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Tutorials** | Learning-oriented, step-by-step | Builds confidence, shows product value |
| **How-to Guides** | Task-oriented, problem-solving | Demonstrates capability breadth |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented, accurate | Proves product depth and reliability |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented, conceptual | Establishes thought leadership |

### Navigation That Reduces Bounce

**Good Navigation Structure:**
```
Getting Started
├── Quickstart (< 5 min)
├── Installation
└── Core Concepts

Guides
├── Authentication
├── [Most Common Use Case]
├── [Second Most Common Use Case]
└── ...

API Reference
├── Overview
├── Authentication
├── Endpoints (alphabetical or logical grouping)
└── SDKs

Resources
├── Examples
├── Changelog
└── Support
```

**Bad Navigation Structure:**
```
Documentation
├── Chapter 1: Introduction
├── Chapter 2: Getting Started
├── Chapter 3: Advanced Topics
├── Appendix A
└── API (link to separate site)
```

### Information Hierarchy

Every documentation page should follow this hierarchy:
1. **What** is this? (1 sentence)
2. **Why** would I use it? (1-2 sentences)
3. **How** do I use it? (the bulk of the page)
4. **What's next?** (clear next steps)

## Quickstart Optimization

Your quickstart is your most important conversion page. Optimize ruthlessly.

### The 5-Minute Rule

Developers should reach a meaningful success moment within 5 minutes. If your quickstart takes longer, you're losing developers.

**Measure and optimize:**
- Time from page load to first successful API call
- Drop-off points in the quickstart flow
- Completion rate

### Quickstart Structure

```markdown
# Quickstart

Get your first [meaningful result] in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites
- [Specific version] of [language/tool]
- [Account/API key] (link to signup)

## Step 1: Install
[Single command, copy-paste ready]

## Step 2: Configure
[Minimal configuration, explain what each part does]

## Step 3: Run
[The payoff—show them it works]

## What You Built
[Explain what just happened and why it matters]

## Next Steps
- [Immediate next tutorial]
- [Reference docs for what they just used]
- [Community/support link]
```

### Good vs. Bad Quickstarts

**Good Quickstart:**
```markdown
# Send Your First Message

Send an SMS in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- A Twilio account ([sign up free](https://github.com/jonathimer/devmarketing-skills/tree/main/skills/docs-as-marketing/link))

## Install the SDK
```bash
npm install twilio
```

## Send a Message
Create `send-sms.js`:
```javascript
const twilio = require('twilio');
const client = twilio('YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID', 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN');

client.messages.create({
  body: 'Hello from my app!',
  to: '+15551234567',
  from: '+15559876543'
}).then(message => console.log(`Sent: ${message.sid}`));
```

Run it:
```bash
node send-sms.js
```

You should see: `Sent: SM1234...`

## What Just Happened
You authenticated with your API credentials and sent an SMS...
```

**Bad Quickstart:**
```markdown
# Getting Started

Welcome to our platform! Before we begin, let's discuss
the architecture of our messaging system...

## Installation

First, ensure you have the correct version of Node.js.
You can check this by running...

You'll also need to configure your environment variables.
Create a .env file and add the following variables...

[Complex configuration with 10+ variables]
```

## API Reference Best Practices

### Every Endpoint Needs

1. **One-sentence description** of what it does
2. **Authentication requirements** clearly stated
3. **Request format** with all parameters documented
4. **Response format** with example
5. **Error responses** with common causes
6. **Copy-paste example** that actually works

### Copy-Paste Code That Works

**Critical**: Example code must work when copied. Test it.

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## Create a User

Creates a new user in your organization.

### Request
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "developer@example.com",
    "name": "Jane Developer"
  }'
```

### Response
```json
{
  "id": "usr_123abc",
  "email": "developer@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Developer",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Errors
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 400 | Invalid email format |
| 409 | Email already exists |
| 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
```

**Bad Example:**
```markdown
## POST /users

Parameters:
- email (string)
- name (string)
- org_id (string, optional)
- role (enum, optional)
- metadata (object, optional)
- ...

Returns a user object.
```

### Language-Specific Examples

Provide examples in languages your developers actually use:
- cURL (universal, always include)
- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP
- Your most-used SDK languages

## Search Optimization for Docs

### Docs That Rank

Developer documentation can capture high-intent search traffic.

**Target Query Types:**
1. **Problem queries**: "how to send sms from node.js"
2. **Comparison queries**: "[your product] vs [competitor]"
3. **Integration queries**: "integrate [your product] with [popular tool]"
4. **Error queries**: "[specific error message]"

### SEO Fundamentals for Docs

**Page Titles:**
```
Good: "Send SMS with Node.js | Twilio Docs"
Bad: "Documentation - Messaging - SMS - Send"
```

**Meta Descriptions:**
```
Good: "Learn how to send SMS messages using Node.js and the
Twilio API. Includes code examples and troubleshooting tips."

Bad: "This page contains documentation for the SMS sending
functionality of our messaging product."
```

**URL Structure:**
```
Good: /docs/sms/send-messages/nodejs
Bad: /docs/section/3/page/27?lang=nodejs
```

### Internal Linking

Create a documentation web, not documentation silos:
- Link related concepts
- Link from reference to tutorials
- Link from tutorials to reference
- Cross-link between SDK docs

## Measuring Documentation Effectiveness

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|------------------|
| Time on quickstart | Engagement (but also confusion) |
| Quickstart completion rate | Conversion effectiveness |
| Search → signup rate | Docs as acquisition channel |
| Support ticket deflection | Docs comprehensiveness |
| Page ratings/feedback | Content quality |
| Internal search queries | Content gaps |

### Feedback Loops

**Implement:**
- "Was this helpful?" on every page
- Internal search analytics (what are people searching for?)
- Support ticket analysis (what questions do docs fail to answer?)
- Developer interviews (what's confusing? What's missing?)

## Common Documentation Anti-Patterns

### The "Wall of Text"
**Problem**: Pages with no code, no structure, no visual breaks
**Fix**: Lead with code, use headers liberally, break up paragraphs

### The "Assumed Knowledge" Trap
**Problem**: Assuming developers know your terminology
**Fix**: Define terms on first use, link to glossary

### The "Everything Page"
**Problem**: One page trying to cover all use cases
**Fix**: Separate pages for distinct tasks, link between them

### The "Outdated Quickstart"
**Problem**: Quickstart code that no longer works
**Fix**: Automated testing of documentation code samples

### The "Hidden Prerequisites"
**Problem**: Discovering requirements mid-tutorial
**Fix**: All prerequisites at the top, with version numbers

## Tools

### Documentation Platforms
- **GitBook**: Good for smaller teams, nice defaults
- **ReadMe**: Interactive API docs, metrics built-in
- **Mintlify**: Modern, fast, good DX
- **Docusaurus**: Flexible, self-hosted, React-based
- **Notion**: Quick to set up, limited customization

### Code Sample Testing
- **Doctest**: Python code in docs
- **mdx-js**: JSX in markdown
- **Custom CI**: Run code samples as tests

### Search and Analytics
- **Algolia DocSearch**: Free for open source, powerful
- **Google Analytics**: Basic traffic metrics
- **FullStory/Hotjar**: Session recording, heatmaps
- **Internal search analytics**: What are devs searching for?

## Related Skills

- **api-onboarding**: Optimize the complete first API call experience
- **sdk-dx**: Create SDKs that make your docs simpler
- **developer-sandbox**: Interactive environments that complement docs
- **technical-content-strategy**: Broader content strategy including docs
- **developer-audience-context**: Understanding who you're writing for

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
