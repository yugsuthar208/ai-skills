# Motion Seed Applier
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need apply a named StyleSeed motion to a component — either one of the 5 personality seeds (Spring/Silk/Snap/Float/Pulse × entrance/exit/hover/press/layout) or a distinctive keyword move from the motion library (toggle-flip, toggle-curtain, reveal-blur, pop-in, shimmer, …). Translates vibe...


## When NOT to use

- For general framer-motion docs or learning → use the framer-motion site
- For non-React motion (CSS-only transitions, GSAP) — this skill targets `motion.X` JSX only
- For full scroll-linked timelines or parallax — out of scope per DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md Rule 59
- For tweaking the existing FadeIn/FadeUp/Stagger wrappers — edit `engine/components/ui/motion.tsx` directly

## Vibe → Seed mapping

Translate the user's prompt to one of the five seeds before applying. Use this lookup table from `engine/motion/index.ts`:

| Words the user might say | Seed |
|---|---|
| bouncy, springy, playful, energetic, alive | **Spring** |
| smooth, silky, fluid, elegant, composed, continuous | **Silk** |
| snappy, quick, instant, decisive, sharp, precise | **Snap** |
| floaty, gentle, weightless, dreamy, ambient, drifting | **Float** |
| rhythmic, punchy, pulsing, heartbeat, beat | **Pulse** |
| "Toss style", "Arc style" | **Spring** (per brand default) |
| "Stripe style", "Notion style" | **Silk** |
| "Linear style", "Raycast style", "Vercel style" | **Snap** |

If the user says only a *brand* name, use that brand's default seed from `BRAND_DEFAULT_SEED`. If the user is explicit about a seed name (`spring`, `silk`, etc.), respect it verbatim.

## Recommend mode — use-case → motion (when the user describes the *moment*, not the vibe)

If the user describes **what the thing is** ("a like button", "a modal", "the loading
state", "items in a feed") rather than a feeling, recommend from the use-case map
(`MOTION_BY_USECASE` in `engine/motion/library.ts`, exported from `@engine/motion`):

| Use case | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Primary button / CTA press | `spring · press` | tactile, confident — the press should "give" |
| Modal / dialog / sheet enter | `silk · entrance` | smooth; never bounce serious/destructive content |
| Dropdown / popover / menu | `snap · entrance` | instant, precise — frequent UI shouldn't wait |
| Toast / inline notification | `spring · entrance` | small friendly arrival, non-blocking |
| List / feed items appearing | `stagger-cascade` | choreograph order, gently |
| Feature / marketing card hover | `tilt-3d` | depth/flair OK on content-light marketing |
| Dashboard / data card hover | `snap · hover` | a subtle lift only — keep dense UI calm |
| Like / favorite / reaction | `like-burst` | a celebratory one-shot; reward the tap |
| Live / online / recording dot | `pulse-beat` | looping heartbeat = "alive" |
| Loading / skeleton | `shimmer` | calm directional progress |
| Success / confirmation | `pop-in` | positive little "done" |
| Toggle / tab / segment switch | `toggle-flip` | distinctive, recognizable switch |
| Page / route transition | `silk · entrance` | smooth, minimal, get out of the way |
| Number / balance / KPI / price reveal | **none** | don't animate the payload — it must read instantly |

**Two anti-rules override the table** (state them if you deviate):
1. **One seed per product.** If the project already uses a seed, match it — don't introduce a second personality.
2. **Never delay the payload.** Don't animate a balance, price, or search result into view; motion is for affordance, not content.

## Named motion keywords (distinctive moves)

Seeds set a *personality* (how a fade/scale feels). The **motion library** in
`engine/motion/library.ts` adds *distinctive moves* — a flip, a curtain wipe, a
morph — each behind a unique keyword. Prefer a keyword when the user wants a
specific, recognizable motion rather than a generic feel.

`engine/motion/library.ts` (exported as `MOTION_LIBRARY` / `MOTION_BY_KEY` from
`@engine/motion`) is the **single source of truth** — every keyword carries its
own runnable `snippet`. Pull the snippet from there; never hand-write the params.

| Keyword | Move | Say it when the user wants… |
|---|---|---|
| `toggle-flip` | 3D Y-axis card flip | a switch/toggle to flip between two faces |
| `toggle-slide` | slide-stack swap | a value to slide out and the next to slide in |
| `toggle-morph` | pill ⇄ circle morph | a control to change shape on toggle |
| `toggle-curtain` | top→bottom clip-path wipe | a panel to reveal like a curtain |
| `reveal-blur` | blur(12px)→0 focus-in | content to focus-pull into place |
| `reveal-rise` | masked clip-path text rise | a headline/text to climb into view |
| `reveal-unfold` | scaleY from top edge | an accordion/panel to unfold |
| `pop-in` | spring overshoot from 0 | a badge/checkmark to pop in bouncily |
| `press-squish` | scale-down + skew | a button to feel jelly/tactile on tap |
| `tap-ripple` | radial ripple from tap | Material-style press feedback |
| `pulse-beat` | looping scale pulse | a live/recording/heartbeat indicator |
| `wiggle` | quick horizontal shake | error / invalid-input feedback |
| `shimmer` | skeleton loading sweep | a loading placeholder |
| `stagger-cascade` | children fade-up in sequence | a list to animate in one-by-one |

**Applying a keyword:**

1. Read the exact recipe from `engine/motion/library.ts` — find the entry whose
   `key` matches, copy its `snippet` verbatim (it is calibrated and runnable).
2. Adapt only the element/content to the user's JSX; keep the transition values.
3. If the keyword is stateful (toggles, ripple), wire the `useState` shown in the
   snippet. If it's a one-shot reveal, a `key` bump replays it.
4. Tell the user the keyword you applied so they can reuse it elsewhere for
   consistency, and point them at `/motion` to preview/Copy others.

If the user describes a move but no exact keyword fits, fall back to a seed +
context. If they say a keyword that doesn't exist, suggest the closest real one
from the table — never invent a keyword.

## Context detection

Infer one of the five contexts from the prompt:

- "on hover" / "when hovered" → `hover`
- "on press" / "on tap" / "on click" → `press`
- "when it appears" / "on mount" / "entering" → `entrance`
- "when it leaves" / "on close" / "exiting" → `exit` (requires `<AnimatePresence>`)
- "when layout changes" / "FLIP" / "rearranging" → `layout`

If ambiguous, default to `entrance`. If multiple contexts are reasonable (e.g., a button needs both `hover` and `press`), apply both.

## Application steps

Apply seed: **$0** · Context: **$1** · Target: **$ARGUMENTS**

1. **Read the target file** at the path given (or, if no path was given, ask the user which file). Locate the JSX element the user is talking about — usually a `<button>`, `<div>`, `<Card>`, or similar.

2. **Confirm the import paths**. The component file must be able to import:
   - `motion` (and `AnimatePresence` for `exit`) from `"framer-motion"`
   - the chosen seed from `"@engine/motion"` — in a project that doesn't use the `@engine/*` alias, use a relative path to `engine/motion`

3. **Replace the target tag with a `<motion.X>` and spread the seed's recipe**:

   ```tsx
   // hover example
   <motion.button {...spring.hover}>Save</motion.button>

   // press + hover combined
   <motion.button {...spring.press} {...spring.hover}>Save</motion.button>

   // entrance (mount)
   <motion.div {...silk.entrance}>...</motion.div>

   // exit (requires AnimatePresence wrapper somewhere up the tree)
   <AnimatePresence>
     {open && <motion.div {...silk.entrance} {...silk.exit} />}
   </AnimatePresence>

   // layout (FLIP)
   <motion.div {...snap.layout}>...</motion.div>
   ```

4. **Do NOT inline the params**. The whole point of the seed is that the values come from one source. Never expand `{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 18 }` into the JSX — always spread the recipe.

5. **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** in long-running surfaces. For one-off interactions (hover/press), framer-motion already throttles. For mount/exit/layout sequences in a long-lived page, import `usePrefersReducedMotion` and `REDUCED_TRANSITION` from `@engine/motion` and override the transition when reduced motion is on.

6. **Validate** by re-reading the file and confirming the JSX still parses (matching brackets, motion tag closed, AnimatePresence in place if `exit` was used).

7. **Tell the user which seed and context you applied**, and offer one related context they might want next ("Want `press` too so it feels clickable?").

## Defaults if the user is vague

- No file given → ask "which file?"
- No vibe word → ask "any vibe word, brand, or seed name?"
- Vibe is "natural" or "feel like a real app" → default to **Silk** (the safest of the five)
- Element is a CTA button → also apply `press`

## Forbidden

- Do not invent new seed names. There are exactly five.
- Do not edit `engine/motion/seeds/*.ts` from this skill — those are calibrated by hand. Add a new seed only via a separate, explicit ask.
- Do not introduce a third-party animation lib (gsap, anime.js). StyleSeed targets framer-motion exclusively.
- Do not add scroll-linked, parallax, or infinite animations (DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md Rule 59).

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
