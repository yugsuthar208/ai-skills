# Data enrichment

Enriching a company, domain, or authorized contact list with public data. Use these workflows only for permitted business research or user-authorized contact enrichment, and respect site terms, robots/access controls, privacy law, opt-out obligations, and rate limits.

## SERP first. Web-scraping is the last resort.

`google-serp` is your primary enrichment tool. Reasons:

- **Google has already extracted the structured fields you want.** `.knowledge_graph` carries HQ, founder, founded year, parent company, employees, industry. `.organic_results[]` titles and snippets carry person → role → employer mappings (LinkedIn titles are literally `Name — Role at Company`). `.local_results[]` carry phone/address/hours.
- **It avoids unnecessary direct access.** Many target sites gate, rate-limit, or restrict scraping. Google's snippets can answer public, high-level questions without rendering the target page.
- **It's a broad public index.** Quoted queries (`--q '"info@example.com"'`, `--q '"+1 555 123 4567"'`, `--q '"Acme Corp"'`) can find publicly indexed business contact or company references.

Use `google-serp` (or `google-news` for recency, `google-maps` for places, `google-shopping` for products) **first**. Only fall through to `web-scraping` when:
- A specific field you need isn't in any SERP snippet, AND
- The target page renders that field server-side or via JS that the scraper can handle, AND
- The user explicitly needs it and has authority to access it (don't fan out to N web-scraping calls when SERP would have answered N - 0 of them).

The patterns below show the full chain so you understand when to escalate. Most rows in a real CSV stop after step 1 or 2.

## Person enrichment

### Step 1 — SERP for role, employer, LinkedIn URL

```bash
hasdata google-serp --q '"Jane Doe" linkedin' --num 5 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | select(.link | contains("linkedin.com/in/")) |
           {title, snippet, link}'
```

The result usually looks like:

```json
{
  "title": "Jane Doe — Senior Engineer at Acme Corp | LinkedIn",
  "snippet": "San Francisco, CA · 500+ connections · Engineering @ Acme. Previously...",
  "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/janedoe"
}
```

You now have role, employer, location, LinkedIn URL, and a connection-count hint — without scraping anything. **Stop here unless a specific extra field is required.**

### Step 2 — Refine with targeted SERP queries

If step 1 didn't carry what you need, ask Google more specifically:

```bash
# Disambiguate by company
hasdata google-serp --q '"Jane Doe" "Acme Corp"' --num 10 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | {title, snippet, link}'

# Other social profiles
hasdata google-serp --q '"Jane Doe" site:twitter.com OR site:x.com' --num 3 --raw
hasdata google-serp --q '"Jane Doe" site:github.com' --num 3 --raw

# Past employers / bio paragraphs
hasdata google-serp --q '"Jane Doe" bio OR background OR experience' --num 5 --raw \
  | jq -r '.organic_results[].snippet'
```

### Step 3 — Web-scraping (only if SERP came up short)

When SERP snippets truncated the field you need, or the user explicitly wants full profile content, first confirm the profile is public or the user has authorization to access it:

```bash
hasdata web-scraping --url "https://www.linkedin.com/in/janedoe" \
  --output-format markdown --no-screenshot --no-block-resources \
  --raw | jq -r .markdown
```

Or for structured fields, AI extraction:

```bash
hasdata web-scraping --url "https://www.linkedin.com/in/janedoe" \
  --ai-extract-rules-json '{
    "headline":   {"type": "string"},
    "location":   {"type": "string"},
    "company":    {"type": "string"},
    "role":       {"type": "string"},
    "followers":  {"type": "number"},
    "experience": {"type": "list", "output": {
      "company":  {"type": "string"},
      "role":     {"type": "string"},
      "duration": {"type": "string"}
    }}
  }' --raw | jq .
```

LinkedIn sometimes blocks the public preview; if it does, fall back to step 2 (combining SERP snippets) — it's almost always enough.

### Email lookup

Triangulate, don't promise. Use this only for business contact discovery, user-authorized enrichment, or another legitimate purpose. SERP first, scraping last; never present a guessed personal email as verified.

```bash
# 1. Has Google already indexed the email anywhere?
hasdata google-serp --q '"jane.doe@acme.com"' --num 10 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | {title, snippet, link}'

# 2. What email format does the company use? Look for any indexed @company.com address.
hasdata google-serp --q 'site:acme.com "@acme.com"' --num 10 --raw \
  | jq -r '.organic_results[].snippet' \
  | grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9._-]+@acme\.com' | sort -u

# 3. Pattern-guess + SERP-verify
for guess in "jane.doe" "jdoe" "jane" "j.doe" "janed"; do
  count=$(hasdata google-serp --q "\"$guess@acme.com\"" --num 1 --raw \
            | jq -r '.organic_results | length')
  [ "$count" -gt 0 ] && echo "$guess@acme.com  (appears in SERP)"
done

# 4. Last resort — scrape the company's public contact / about / team pages for emails
hasdata web-scraping --url "https://acme.com/about" --extract-emails --raw \
  | jq -r '.emails // [] | .[]'
```

Always tell the user when an email is a pattern-guess vs. confirmed via SERP/scrape, and avoid collecting personal contact data when the user lacks authorization.

## Company enrichment

### Step 1 — SERP knowledge_graph

```bash
hasdata google-serp --q "Acme Corp" --num 5 --raw | jq '.knowledge_graph // {}'
```

`.knowledge_graph` typically contains: founder, founded (year), headquarters, parent_organization, ceo, employees (range), revenue, stock_price, industry, products. **For the majority of company enrichment requests, this single call is the entire answer.**

### Step 2 — Targeted SERP for specific fields

```bash
# Headquarters
hasdata google-serp --q '"Acme Corp" headquarters' --num 5 --raw \
  | jq -r '.organic_results[].snippet'

# Funding / acquisition signals
hasdata google-serp --q '"Acme Corp" raises OR acquires OR acquired OR ipo OR funding' --num 10 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | {title, snippet, link}'

# Recent news
hasdata google-news --q "Acme Corp" --gl us --raw \
  | jq -c '.news_results[] | {title, source: .source.name, date, link}'

# LinkedIn company page
hasdata google-serp --q '"Acme Corp" site:linkedin.com/company' --num 3 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | {title, snippet, link}'

# Employee profiles in a specific function/region
hasdata google-serp \
  --q 'site:linkedin.com/in "Acme Corp" engineer' --gl us --num 25 --raw \
  | jq -r '.organic_results[] | "\(.title)\t\(.link)"'
```

### Step 3 — Web-scraping (only when SERP can't fill a specific field)

```bash
# Company About page → AI-extract structured fields
hasdata web-scraping --url "https://acme.com/about" \
  --ai-extract-rules-json '{
    "name":         {"type": "string"},
    "founded":      {"type": "number"},
    "headquarters": {"type": "string"},
    "employees":    {"type": "string"},
    "industry":     {"type": "string"},
    "description":  {"type": "string"},
    "products":     {"type": "list"}
  }' --raw | jq .
```

Reach for this only when the user wants something SERP can't provide (e.g. mission statement verbatim, full product taxonomy, leadership team page parsed into rows).

---

## CSV row enrichment

For a list of N rows, fan out one or two SERP calls per row. Keep web-scraping out of the loop unless a specific row needs it.

```bash
# Input: people.csv with one column "name"
while IFS=, read -r name; do
  result=$(hasdata google-serp --q "\"$name\" linkedin" --num 1 --raw)
  linkedin=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.organic_results[0].link // ""')
  title=$(echo "$result"    | jq -r '.organic_results[0].title // ""')
  snippet=$(echo "$result"  | jq -r '.organic_results[0].snippet // ""')
  printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$name" "$title" "$snippet" "$linkedin"
done < people.csv > enriched.tsv
```

That's it. One SERP call per row, role/employer/LinkedIn extracted from the title and snippet. Add a second SERP call only if a row's first result didn't match (`select(.title | test("\(name)"; "i"))` filtering for confidence).

---

## Reverse-lookup

Always SERP-first with the literal value quoted. Use reverse lookup only for user-authorized investigation, business contact verification, or another legitimate purpose; do not use it for doxxing, stalking, harassment, or collecting private personal data.

```bash
# Business email → public identity signal
hasdata google-serp --q '"jane@example.com"' --num 10 --raw \
  | jq -c '.organic_results[] | {title, snippet, link}'

# Business phone → owner / business
hasdata google-serp --q '"+1 555 123 4567"' --num 10 --raw
# Combine with yelp-search / yellowpages-search if it's a business number.

# Domain → company
hasdata google-serp --q "site:example.com" --num 5 --raw \
  | jq '.organic_results[0].title'
hasdata google-serp --q "Acme Corp" --num 5 --raw | jq '.knowledge_graph // {}'
```

Only scrape the domain (`web-scraping --url "https://example.com"`) when you specifically need the homepage's body text.

## Tips for reliable enrichment

- **Always quote names and other multi-token strings** — `"Jane Doe"` matches the exact person; `Jane Doe` matches noise.
- **Use `site:` aggressively** — `site:linkedin.com/in/`, `site:linkedin.com/company/`, `site:github.com`, `site:crunchbase.com`. Google's `site:` is the cheapest way to scope an enrichment search.
- **Read the `.knowledge_graph`** before doing anything else for a company. If it's populated, you're often done.
- **AI-extract over CSS selectors** when you do need to scrape — LinkedIn / Crunchbase / About-page markup changes constantly; AI extraction with field names + descriptions survives layout churn.
- **Cross-source verify** — never enrich from a single source. If LinkedIn's title says "Acme Corp" and a `--q '"Jane Doe" "Acme Corp"'` SERP corroborates with multiple results, confidence is high.
- **Mark guesses** — pattern-guessed emails, inferred locations, single-source roles should be flagged to the user as unverified.
- **Respect privacy and authorization** — do not collect or infer personal contact details without a legitimate purpose and user authority.
