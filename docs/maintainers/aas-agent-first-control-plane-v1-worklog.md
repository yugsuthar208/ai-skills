# AAS Agent-First Control Plane v1 Worklog

- 2026-07-19: Semantic skill selection moved to Codex and Claude. Core now exposes the complete catalog and validates/pins exact agent-selected IDs through `compose_stack`; selection policy and metadata eligibility gates were retired. Every canonical skill must remain searchable, readable, and available for agent selection. Earlier recommendation entries below are historical.

## 2026-07-18 — Baseline workflow retired

- The standalone `aas-v1-baseline` pull-request workflow and required status check were retired by maintainer decision. The obsolete verifier corpus, harness, tuning runner, and paused apply/optimize workflows were subsequently removed. The protected `pr-policy`, `pr-evidence`, `source-validation`, and `artifact-preview` gates remain required.
- Entries below this point are a historical construction log. References to frozen verifier assets, matrices, paths, or pending certification gates describe the state at that date and are not current repository policy.

## 2026-07-17 — Goal activation and clean baseline

- Active objective is defined by the approved design and goal documents.
- Original worktree `/Users/nicco/Projects/antigravity-awesome-skills` contains unrelated local-skill-reviewer work and remains untouched.
- Created isolated worktree `/private/tmp/aas-agent-first-control-plane-v1` on branch `codex/aas-agent-first-control-plane-v1` from `origin/main` commit `4101f32402448f4fdd96b3cf166a81b8cee8b557`.
- Live source baseline: `origin/main` current; latest main CI, CodeQL, Actionlint, and Pages succeeded; no open Dependabot, code-scanning, secret-scanning, or runtime npm-audit findings.
- Open PRs 867 and 871 are unrelated skill contributions and remain out of scope.
- Copied the approved design and goal packet into the isolated branch.

## Phase 0 status

- Freeze-ready baseline complete: 11 public schemas, exact metric formulas, fixed 100,000 property/generative and 50,000 parser/MCP fuzz budgets, six exact OS/Node jobs, and zero pending requirements.
- Benchmark corpus: 180 held-out cases and accepted-equivalent gold sets, 60 disjoint tuning cases, and 30 disjoint explicit out-of-coverage abstention cases. The six intents each retain a denominator of 30 held-out cases.
- Independent review: `codex-independent-alpha` and `codex-independent-beta` each approved all 270 case/gold or case/label pairs. Their content-addressed reports are bound by `verification/aas-v1/ownership.v1.json`; both reviewers are independent of the future scorer implementation.
- Hostile corpus: 32 exploit/control classes, 64 hash-verified fixtures, zero extracted archives, and zero special filesystem entries.
- Registry legacy baseline: `ai-skills@14.6.0`, SRI `sha512-VTOb3O9PSYKCDO99i3h0vOn7vHQlGtO/+jSErR80g6OGaDJoBzg3q2GE9Nu890en1/Z54hBEYiVQj/1Rl95xEg==`, tarball SHA-256 `98f8cbb399613621598ac6aeca619fc7c454530895b4e237eee695d82fbdf0cb`, tag commit `ab5f6c205a548d2f4bec411728c79b9c156fc696`.
- Legacy replay: 41 command cases pass with fixture tree `sha256-80c220b08a221685c26a23e2cd7c1b06628bfec7a542fa91d8ee19a5d3e035f8` and aggregate fake-Git trace `sha256-b36ea8cfd26d642235ce061bb5dcc925bec4b5bf63137cc17edb702b62560384`. Two consecutive complete replays produced the same 64-file corpus aggregate `3797c2c61c6334aa8081380be11958cd555d277baa26114e0cbe35fd62e099f6`.
- The legacy harness binds the exact dependency closure, runtime tree, and entrypoint; validates pre/post filesystem evidence; constrains case, target, and fake-Git paths; observes and denies Node networking with a sentinel self-test; and records zero network attempts. Full OS-syscall observation remains a separate black-box product acceptance gate and is not claimed by this corpus.
- Live `main` protection now requires `aas-v1-baseline`, while retaining `pr-policy`, `pr-evidence`, `source-validation`, and `artifact-preview`; admin enforcement remains enabled and force-pushes/deletions remain disabled.
- Local gate: 9/9 verifier tests, schema validation, structure validation, frozen benchmark and secondary corpora, hostile fixtures, legacy snapshots, and freeze readiness all pass.
- Content-addressed freeze manifest: 712 files, root digest `sha256-c7a4d4b3efa9f2bdf5a126fc3c384680d39534880a3900302785397e4ddd451c`; an immediate independent `freeze:check` reproduced it exactly. GitHub's Linux replay exposed zlib-version variation in valid DEFLATE streams; gzip fixtures now require the frozen compressed digest plus deterministic expanded USTAR bytes and preserve the canonical committed stream during regeneration.

## Feasibility decisions

1. A v1 mutating plan is single-target and single-filesystem. Multi-target manifests generate independently approved plans. This avoids claiming impossible crash-atomic commit across unrelated filesystems.
2. The pure-Node implementation uses atomic exclusive lock creation, file handles, type/ownership/realpath/identity revalidation, same-filesystem staging, journal, fsync, and atomic rename. It documents that portable Node lacks descriptor-relative `openat`/`renameat`; a malicious same-user process is already outside the frozen threat boundary. No native addon is added to v1.
3. Legacy `install.js` remains isolated. The new stack transaction engine will not reuse its per-entry mutation path.

## Next evidence gate

- Baseline landed through protected PR [#878](https://github.com/yug/ai-skills/pull/878) as `09f2d8612d2e68a087377685e9c876bd737e1782`. Required `aas-v1-baseline`, source validation, and artifact preview passed from committed bytes.
- Product implementation now runs in isolated worktree `/private/tmp/aas-agent-first-product` on `codex/aas-agent-first-control-plane-v1-product`, based on that protected commit. `verification/aas-v1` remains unchanged.

## Phase 1 — Deterministic core and immutable state contracts

- Added a pure CommonJS deterministic core with canonical JSON, explicit version handshake, allowlisted input normalization, public metadata judgments, complete-catalog search, deterministic recommendation/discovery lanes, fixed-point lexical factors, and greedy set-cover composition with skill budget, overlap penalty, dependencies, and conflicts.
- Canonical registry identity uses `canonical_id`, exposing all 1,965 skills exactly once. Generated compatibility defaults are not treated as authoritative support evidence; absent reviewed metadata remains `unknown`.
- The first tuning-only metadata overlay covered the 85 candidate IDs referenced by tuning gold. Independent audit rejected that approach as an indirect gold-derived whitelist: tuning/gold review is not proof of skill quality or provenance. This overlay is development history only and must be replaced before product acceptance. No held-out input was read.
- Added 11 public v1 schemas, strict minimal-manifest validation, exact version handshake, and immutable single-target plan envelopes. Plans bind manifest, catalog, runtime, target identity, installed state, logical operations, overrides, and a final state commit without physical destination paths.
- Added a tuning-only diagnostic runner. After conservative removal of unsupported capability claims, the honest baseline was macro verified coverage `0.366667` and macro inclusion precision `0.911859`. Coverage by intent was `0.4/0.2/0.4/0.4/0.4/0.4`; this is a development diagnostic, not held-out evidence or a release claim.
- Corrected the compositor to be lexicographically coverage-first, forbid non-critical-only additions while critical goals remain uncovered, use exact versioned capability matching, and keep search-only ID tokens out of recommendation BM25. The same still-gold-derived development overlay then measured `0.366667` coverage and `0.928030` macro precision; it remains rejected as product evidence.
- Added a benchmark-independent public review queue over all 1,965 catalog entries and 120 versioned capabilities. Three independent semantic audits selected and reviewed 121 unique candidates across the six intents without reading tuning gold or held-out data. Field-level risk, provenance, setup, dependency, and conflict evidence is being audited separately; unknown values remain unknown.

## Phase 2 — Local runtime, CLI/MCP, transaction, and review UI slices

- Added content-addressed catalog and runtime caches, canonical identity records, npm `dist.integrity` verification, data-only catalog update, a hardened archive parser, and atomic cache promotion. The hostile archive matrix passes 34/34; updater/cache/archive targeted tests pass 44/44.
- A fresh current-worktree npm tarball was parsed and promoted as a runtime without lifecycle execution: 6,455 files, 99,652,053 expanded bytes, SRI `sha512-tulK12nYIjp0JNrwAUQgDnluU5X8BXuhzrJ5lBWeZvKBOA6ENs2/QuxKpgv4hR3hU/GaTQDdNSYTV7YLnJfERg==`, closure `sha256-5c8c616cea0c9fb5d62fc707647a71e554001bbea0dea915a4865bb92345f22c`; every cached byte verified.
- Added the `aas` lifecycle for catalog status/update, stack init/recommend/validate/plan/apply/doctor/recover, exact plan/recovery approvals, and legacy argument dispatch isolation. Added Codex/Claude host adapters plus explicit `mcp configure` preview/apply and backup cleanup; real user configuration remains untouched.
- Added the five-tool read-only local MCP server and resource template with strict bounded JSON-lines parsing, offline catalog resolution, no updater, no model, and no write surface. Unit/static evidence does not replace the required external syscall observation.
- Added transactional apply with same-filesystem staging, exclusive lock, chained journal, backup, state-last commit, idempotence, and explicit recovery. Unit fault hooks do not replace the required production-binary kill/swap/race matrix.
- Replaced the manual Workbench selector with in-memory paste/upload review of stack and plan artifacts. The route is isolated from catalog/Supabase fetch, renders text-only evidence, and exposes no install/apply/share/persistence surface. App tests pass 152/152 and the production build/prerender passes locally.
- Current integrated AAS v1 unit suite passed 87/87 before the latest runtime and metadata-hardening additions; a fresh full rerun is required after integration. Frozen `verification/aas-v1` remains unchanged from protected baseline commit `09f2d8612d2e68a087377685e9c876bd737e1782`.

## Phase 2 integration update — current product tree

- Replaced the rejected tuning-derived overlay with committed, benchmark-independent review sources. The pipeline deterministically validates 120 public capability queues, imports 121 independent metadata reviews, builds 121 overrides, and emits all 1,965 catalog records at catalog digest `sha256-cf14b1b22b826b5aed3f82f7ea3c8895b4b5ae1af372bd310b7154db80bb4628`. Dependency-path tests forbid frozen verification, held-out, and gold inputs. No held-out case has been read by the product implementation.
- Real Draft 2020-12 instance validation now covers recommendation input, catalog manifest, plans, recovery plans, journal records, managed state, doctor output, and CLI success/error envelopes. Recommendation validation occurs before normalization, so malformed booleans, targets, policy, and unknown fields fail closed.
- Runtime packaging now bundles the declared npm dependency closure and promotes only allowlisted runtime assets. The current commit-bound tarball is 42,307,013 bytes with SHA-256 `3a1478e84f02692313a72656041b0d114dcc57d1906c53f0da83243dfdc2c9f1` and npm integrity `sha512-T2kL318lXJBms8GeFIbeMcCileDWJ2gqCjpckQa4llWsWpA7jFdRNeuD2EfN0Ce/7K2LkBuFNDD0GdM2jegbXg==`; its 7,237 selected runtime assets total 100,632,903 bytes and bind closure digest `sha256-bb527d301fa696ba319ccd6b1a745410da1861b5f86f328ceb46e4ca6e085b5c`. The tarball is installed into an isolated content-addressed cache, reverified byte-for-byte, and launches `aas-mcp` successfully with `NODE_PATH` cleared. The published `aas` and `aas-mcp` bins are asserted executable on POSIX and smoke-tested from the installed tarball.
- Transaction recovery now uses a root-anchored WAL plus bootstrap evidence, crash-safe pending publication, immutable checkpoints, mutation intent/completion records, target locking, state-last commit, and retryable rollback/cleanup. Explicit fault tests cover bootstrap rename before fsync, layout publication before fsync, tombstone cleanup interruption, torn WAL tails, interrupted mutation recovery, post-commit cleanup, empty prior state, live locks, stale recovery guards, and symlink/containment drift.
- Windows-specific source paths reject NTFS streams/device aliases/reserved names, harden backup and staging ACLs before sensitive bytes, preserve existing config ACLs, and request a `GENERIC_WRITE` directory handle for `FlushFileBuffers`. These paths fail closed but are not claimed as executed evidence until the protected Windows matrix runs.
- Recommendation output now keeps full deterministic scoring while returning compact evidence summaries: at most 25 candidates per lane, 25 detailed exclusions, total/returned counts, reason-code counts, and at most eight content-addressed evidence references per candidate. It no longer embeds a second copy of itself. Across all 60 tuning cases, the largest serialized MCP tool result is 203,884 bytes. The frozen hostile regex-like search query is rejected before tokenization while normal technical queries such as `c++ node.js api/v1` remain valid.
- `mcp configure` now has two explicit and non-ambiguous runtime paths. Registry bootstrap/update continues to preview and bind the exact npm SRI before download. Supplying both `--runtime-integrity` and `--runtime-closure-digest` selects an already verified content-addressed runtime without any registry access; preview binds the complete identity and apply reverifies every cached byte immediately before the atomic host-config write. Supplying only one identity component, a missing runtime, a closure mismatch, or post-preview tampering fails closed without a config write.
- Current local gates: skill validation for 1,965 skills, docs-security checks, deterministic catalog checks, 128/128 AAS v1 tests, the complete repository test suite, 152/152 Workbench tests, production Vite build/prerender, package-content checks, isolated CLI/MCP tarball smoke, and `git diff --check` pass. This supersedes the earlier stale 87-test snapshot above.
- The canonical `repo-maintainer` skill now preserves the independent product/verifier/gold boundary. Its packaged mirrors remain owned by the protected canonical-sync flow and will be regenerated only after the source PR lands. The installed private `antigravity-maintainer-batch-release` skill and its UI metadata were also updated and validated so future sweeps retain the same frozen-matrix, black-box, and publication-approval gates.
- Honest tuning-only diagnostic remains below release thresholds: macro verified coverage `0.366667`, macro inclusion precision `0.563889`, critical-goal coverage `0.616667`, and non-critical-goal coverage `0.533333`, with zero hard-policy violations. Inspection showed semantically valid alternatives omitted from the current frozen tuning gold. Changing that gold is prohibited without a separate independent equivalence audit, explicit approval, protected PR, and baseline re-freeze.

## Remaining approval gates

- Explicit approval was granted for the independently owned product black-box verifier and six-job Node 22/24 acceptance workflow for Linux, macOS, and Windows. That work remains isolated from the product branch and must land through its own protected PR before the baseline is re-frozen.
- Explicit approval was granted for an independent tuning-gold equivalence audit. Its accepted equivalences, review evidence, and updated freeze remain isolated on their own branch and must land through a separate protected PR. Product code has not tuned around the known omissions or read held-out inputs.
- Only after those two gates pass may the clean-tarball held-out/abstention evaluator, 100,000 property cases, 50,000 parser/MCP fuzz cases, observed zero-network/zero-write MCP traces, production-binary fault/race matrix, legacy differential, host smoke tests, and exact evidence bundle be treated as release acceptance.
- Tag, npm publication, Pages deployment, or writes to real user MCP configuration remain separately approval-gated and have not occurred.

## 2026-07-17 — Additive agent-first preview profile

- The frozen certified-v1 design, benchmark, hostile corpus, verifier, and goal
  remain unchanged. The new preview profile is an intermediate product-learning
  gate and cannot complete the active certified-v1 goal.
- `stack apply` and `stack recover` are now disabled by default in the preview.
  Controlled development requires `--experimental-apply` or
  `--experimental-recovery`; successful writes are labelled experimental.
- Added a packed-product functional runner for `init -> recommend -> validate ->
  plan -> doctor`, deterministic explanation output, all five local stdio MCP
  tools, the skill resource template, read-only project/cache snapshots, legacy
  isolation, and default write guards.
- Added a six-job Node 22/24 matrix for Linux, macOS, and Windows, plus Workbench
  tests/build and a fail-closed receipt aggregator. A passing bundle must say
  `previewQualified: true` and `certifiedV1: false` and must enumerate native
  syscall observation, transactional crash/race certification, the 80/90/100
  benchmark, real host writes, and public release as not evaluated.
- The preview contract and evidence bundle preserve this boundary. Any further
  canonical maintainer-skill wording change remains a separate source/sync
  maintenance action, so this product PR does not create registry drift.
- No npm package, GitHub release, Pages deployment, announcement, or real MCP
  configuration write is authorized by this profile.
