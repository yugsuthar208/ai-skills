## Setup

The optional setup below clones and runs a third-party Node project from
`tellmefrankie/news-engine`. Review and pin that repository yourself before
running it, and do not expose API keys to an unreviewed checkout.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tellmefrankie/news-engine
cd news-engine
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Requires: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
pnpm dev -- --collect-only
```

No paid APIs required for free tier. Anthropic API key only.

## Limitations

- RSS feeds can lag, disappear, throttle, or duplicate syndicated coverage.
- Sentiment and impact scores are briefing aids, not authoritative market or policy analysis.
- The example setup runs third-party code; review the repository and environment variables before use.
- Outputs should be cross-checked against original article sources before publication or investment use.

## Pro Version

Free tier covers news collection and basic analysis.

**Full bundle — $29 one-time**: Investment-grade analysis (portfolio impact scoring, options flow correlation, earnings catalyst detection), Telegram auto-delivery.
