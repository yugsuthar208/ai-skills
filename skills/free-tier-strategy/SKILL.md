# Free Tier Strategy
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need design free tiers that convert to paid without creating resentment or abuse. Trigger phrases: free tier design, freemium model, free trial strategy, free tier limits, developer free plan, open source commercial, feature gating, upgrade triggers, free tier conversion.


Design free tiers that let developers build real things, demonstrate value, and convert naturally—without feeling like a trap or creating resentment.

## Overview

Developer tools need free tiers. Developers expect to try before they buy, and they expect the trial to be meaningful—not a 14-day timer or a feature-locked demo. But free tiers also need to sustain your business. Get this wrong in either direction: too restrictive kills adoption, too generous kills revenue.

The best free tiers feel generous to individual developers while naturally scaling into paid tiers as projects grow.

## Before You Start

Review the `/devmarketing-skills/skills/developer-audience-context` skill. Free tier design varies significantly based on whether you're targeting hobbyists, startups, or enterprises. Also understand your unit economics—what does each free user actually cost you?

## Free Tier vs Free Trial vs Freemium

### Definitions

**Free trial:** Time-limited full access (14 or 30 days)
- Best for: High-touch enterprise sales
- Worst for: Developer tools with self-serve motion

**Free tier:** Permanently free with usage/feature limits
- Best for: Developer tools with self-serve adoption
- Requires: Careful limit design

**Freemium:** Free tier plus premium features for payment
- Best for: Tools with clear hobby/pro distinction
- Requires: Obvious value in premium features

**Open core:** Free open source with commercial additions
- Best for: Infrastructure and platforms
- Requires: Active open source community

### Choosing Your Model

| Factor | Free Trial | Free Tier | Freemium | Open Core |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Sales motion | High-touch | Self-serve | Self-serve | Mixed |
| Time to evaluate | Weeks | Months | Months | Unlimited |
| Conversion pressure | High | Low | Medium | None |
| Community building | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Support costs | High | Low | Medium | Variable |

**Developer tools almost always need a permanent free tier, not a free trial.** Developers build side projects, evaluate tools for future use, and recommend tools to others—all of which require long-term free access.

## Usage Limits That Make Sense

### Good Limit Dimensions

**API calls/requests**
- Developers understand and can track
- Scales naturally with application growth
- Example: 10,000 requests/month

**Compute resources**
- Clear relationship to cost
- Predictable for developers
- Example: 500 build minutes/month

**Storage**
- Easy to understand
- Natural upgrade trigger as data grows
- Example: 1GB storage

**Seats/users**
- Makes sense for collaboration tools
- Natural upgrade for team growth
- Example: Up to 3 team members

### Bad Limit Dimensions

**Time-based trials disguised as free tiers**
- "Free tier expires after 90 days of inactivity"
- Creates anxiety and resentment

**Arbitrary feature combinations**
- "Free: 3 projects with 2 environments each, max 5 databases per environment, 100MB per database"
- Too complex to evaluate

**Limits that punish success**
- "Free up to 100 monthly active users"
- Your most successful free users hit limits fastest

### The Goldilocks Zone

Free tier limits should:
1. **Allow meaningful usage** - Build and run a real side project
2. **Cover hobbyist use cases** - Personal projects should never require payment
3. **Trigger on growth, not time** - Upgrades happen because projects succeed
4. **Be easy to predict** - Developers should know when they'll hit limits

### Example: Good Limit Structure

**Vercel:**
- Unlimited personal projects
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Serverless function limits
- Hobby use stays free forever

**Supabase:**
- 500MB database storage
- 2GB bandwidth
- 50,000 monthly active users
- Social auth unlimited

**PlanetScale:**
- 1 database
- 1 billion row reads/month
- 10 million row writes/month
- 5GB storage

## Feature Gating Strategies

### The Free Features Principle

Free tiers should include everything needed to:
1. Evaluate the product thoroughly
2. Build and ship a real project
3. Operate in production at small scale

### Features to Keep Free

- Core functionality
- All integrations and SDKs
- Standard authentication
- Basic monitoring and logs
- Documentation and community support
- Development and testing environments

### Features to Gate Behind Paid Tiers

**Collaboration features:**
- Team members beyond the solo developer
- Access controls and permissions
- Audit logs

**Scale and performance:**
- Higher rate limits
- More compute/storage
- Premium infrastructure (dedicated instances)

**Enterprise requirements:**
- SSO/SAML
- SLAs and uptime guarantees
- Priority support
- Compliance certifications
- Custom contracts

### Feature Gating Anti-Patterns

**Gating basic developer needs:**
```
Bad: Custom domains require paid plan
(Custom domains are table stakes)

Bad: CI/CD integration requires paid plan
(This is how developers deploy)

Bad: Environment variables limited on free
(This is basic functionality)
```

**Gating that breaks evaluation:**
```
Bad: "Advanced features" available for 7 days then locked
(Developers can't properly evaluate)

Bad: Production deploys require credit card
(Can't demonstrate to stakeholders)
```

## Avoiding "Free Tier Tax" Resentment

### What Creates Resentment

1. **Hidden degradation** - Free tier is slower, less reliable
2. **Feature removal** - Features moved from free to paid
3. **Surprise limits** - Hitting limits without warning
4. **Contemptuous messaging** - "Upgrade to unlock BASIC features"
5. **Support discrimination** - Free users treated as second-class

### Creating Positive Free Tier Experience

**Clear expectations:**
```
Free tier includes:
- Everything you need to build and launch
- No credit card required
- No time limits

Upgrade when you need:
- Team collaboration
- Higher usage limits
- Priority support
```

**Graceful limit handling:**
```
You've used 8,000 of 10,000 free API calls this month.

Options:
- Wait for reset on March 1st
- Upgrade to Pro ($29/mo) for 100,000 calls
- Request temporary limit increase (for launches)
```

**Honest feature comparisons:**
Don't artificially cripple free tier to make paid look better.

### The GitHub Model

GitHub's free tier evolution shows how to do this well:
1. Free private repos (previously paid)
2. Free CI/CD minutes for public repos
3. Free Copilot for open source maintainers
4. Generous free tier for organizations

Result: Developers love GitHub, happily pay when they need more.

## Upgrade Triggers and Timing

### Natural Upgrade Triggers

**Growth triggers:**
- Hit usage limits (bandwidth, storage, API calls)
- Add team members
- Create more projects/environments
- Need more history/retention

**Maturity triggers:**
- Move to production
- Need uptime SLA
- Require compliance
- Want premium support

### Trigger Communication

**Bad: Nagging**
```
[Popup every login]
Upgrade to Pro! 50% off this week only!
[Dismiss] [Upgrade]
```

**Good: Contextual**
```
[When approaching limits]
You're at 85% of your free tier API calls.
Your current usage suggests you'll hit the limit in 3 days.

[View usage] [Explore plans]
```

**Better: Helpful**
```
[When adding 4th team member]
Free tier includes 3 team members.

To add more collaborators, upgrade to Team ($25/user/mo).
This includes: [benefits relevant to teams]

[Not now - stay with 3] [Upgrade to Team]
```

### Timing Principles

1. **Never interrupt workflow** - Don't block actions with upgrade prompts
2. **Warn before limits** - 70%, 85%, 95% notifications
3. **Explain the trigger** - "You're seeing this because..."
4. **Offer alternatives** - Not just "upgrade or suffer"
5. **Remember choices** - Don't repeat dismissed prompts daily

## Open Source + Commercial Models

### The Open Core Model

```
Open Source (MIT/Apache)          Commercial
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Self-hosted core                  Cloud hosting
Community support                 Priority support
Standard features                 Enterprise features (SSO, audit)
                                  Compliance and SLAs
```

### Making Open Core Work

**Clear boundary:**
Developers should know exactly what's open source and what's commercial.

**Good example (GitLab):**
- Community Edition: Complete Git platform
- Enterprise Edition: Advanced security, compliance
- SaaS: Managed hosting with CE or EE features

**Open source must be useful:**
The open source version should be genuinely useful, not crippled. Developers will notice and resent "open-source-washing."

### Commercialization Strategies

**Cloud vs self-hosted:**
- Open source: Self-host for free
- Commercial: Managed cloud hosting
- Example: Plausible, Metabase, Supabase

**Enterprise features:**
- Open source: Complete for individual/small team
- Commercial: SSO, audit logs, compliance
- Example: GitLab, Sourcegraph

**Support and SLA:**
- Open source: Community support
- Commercial: Priority support, uptime SLA
- Example: Most open source databases

### Community Relationship

**Do:**
- Contribute genuinely to open source
- Accept community contributions
- Maintain transparency about commercial decisions
- Offer free commercial tier for open source projects

**Don't:**
- Relicense or change terms suddenly (see HashiCorp, Redis, Elastic)
- Compete with community-built features by commercializing them
- Use open source primarily as marketing
- Ignore community feedback on commercial boundaries

## Pricing Page Communication

### Show Limits Clearly

```
Free                    Pro ($29/mo)           Enterprise
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10,000 API calls        100,000 API calls      Unlimited
1GB storage             50GB storage           Unlimited
3 team members          25 team members        Unlimited
Community support       Email support          Priority + SLA
```

### FAQ Free Tier Questions

Every pricing page needs:
- "Is the free tier actually free forever?"
- "What happens when I hit limits?"
- "Can I use free tier for commercial projects?"
- "Do I need a credit card for free tier?"

### Pricing Page Examples

**Excellent: Vercel**
- Clear free tier description
- Per-feature limit comparison
- Usage calculator
- "Hobby" framing (not "limited")

**Excellent: Supabase**
- Generous free tier prominent
- Clear limit numbers
- Feature comparison table
- Open source status visible

## Examples: Free Tiers That Work

### Stripe

- No monthly fee for free tier
- Pay only on transactions (2.9% + 30¢)
- Test mode unlimited and forever
- Full feature access
- Why it works: Aligns cost with revenue

### Cloudflare

- Generous free tier (unlimited bandwidth)
- Premium features clearly differentiated
- Free tier is genuinely useful for most sites
- Why it works: Free users become advocates

### MongoDB Atlas

- 512MB storage free forever
- Shared cluster (good enough for learning)
- All features available to test
- Why it works: Devs learn on free, companies pay

### Algolia

- 10,000 records free
- 10,000 search requests/month
- Full API access
- Why it works: Scales with application success

## Examples: Free Tier Problems

### Anti-Pattern: The Hidden Trial

"Free tier" that expires after 90 days of inactivity, or reduces limits after initial period.

### Anti-Pattern: The Feature Prison

Core features locked behind payment, making free tier useless for evaluation.

### Anti-Pattern: The Support Desert

Free users get AI chatbot only, can't access any human help even for bugs.

### Anti-Pattern: The Sudden Rug Pull

Previously free features moved behind paywall without grandfathering.

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
