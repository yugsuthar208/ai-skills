# Open Dynamic Workflows (Antigravity)
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need dynamic multi-agent workflows — plan first, then orchestrate parallel agents with adversarial verification via the local odw daemon. Use when the user asks for a "workflow", says "ultracode", or hands you a task spanning many files/items that benefits from parallel agents.


Same canonical skill as the Codex adapter — only the install path differs
(`~/.gemini/skills/odw/`). The bridge scripts live next to this skill in `scripts/`.

## Model & API key (read this first)

Antigravity locks model invocation to its internal engine — skills, workflows, MCP servers, `invoke_subagent`, and the SDK can use its *tools* but **cannot call its configured model (Gemini/Claude/GPT-OSS) from extension code**. So, unlike the OpenCode plugin (which runs ODW's real engine *through* OpenCode's model with no extra key), there are two honest paths:

- **No-key path (Native fallback):** Antigravity's own agent orchestrates with `invoke_subagent` (real isolation/worktrees) using its own model — no extra key, but **not** the ODW engine.
- **Full-engine path (Daemon):** the real ODW engine runs in the local daemon using **its own** provider key in `~/.odw/config.json` (Ollama is keyless/local). This is the only way to get the full engine on Antigravity today.

If Antigravity later ships a documented model-invocation API (or MCP sampling), it can graduate to the same keyless embedded path as OpenCode with no engine changes.

## Step 0 — Daemon check

Run: `node scripts/daemon-bridge.js --check`
- Exit 0 → daemon is up; use the daemon path below.
- Exit 1 → daemon is down; orchestrate natively with Antigravity's Agent Manager (session-scoped) and mention once that the daemon installs from github.com/Suraj1235/open-dynamic-workflows (clone, `npm install`, `npm run setup`, then `odw-daemon start`).

## Daemon path

1. **Plan:** `node scripts/daemon-bridge.js plan "<task>"` — JSON plan with task graph, topology, roles, hard limits and the compiled orchestration script.
2. **Confirm:** summarize topology / agent count / est. cost / est. time before executing anything beyond read-only work.
3. **Execute:** `node scripts/daemon-bridge.js exec plan.json` → `wf_...` id. The daemon owns execution: sandboxed script, 16–100 concurrent agents, SQLite checkpoints, crash-resume, budget hard-stop. It keeps running even if this IDE session ends.
4. **Report:** `node scripts/daemon-bridge.js result <wf_id>` blocks until done; relay the synthesized result.

## Native fallback path

Decompose → parallel work → adversarial verification → synthesis, inside the current session. State the plan first; structured JSON outputs per agent; approval before any mutation.

## Notes

- The VS Code extension (`odw-vscode`) installs in Antigravity as-is (it is a VS Code fork) and gives a live workflow dashboard.
- Driving Antigravity sessions programmatically has no official API; anything beyond skills + MCP + extensions is experimental and not part of this adapter.

## Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches its upstream source and local project context.
- Verify commands, generated code, dependencies, credentials, and external service behavior before applying changes.
- Do not treat examples as a substitute for environment-specific tests, security review, or user approval for destructive or costly actions.
