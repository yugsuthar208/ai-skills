This skill helps you build and manage developer communities on Discord, Slack, forums, and other platforms. Covers channel structure, onboarding, engagement programs, handling toxicity, and community-led growth.

## Before You Start

**Load your audience context first.** Read `.agents/developer-audience-context.md` to understand:

- Who your developers are (role, seniority, interests)
- Where they already hang out (to avoid competing platforms)
- What problems they discuss (community topic focus)
- How they communicate (formal vs. casual tone)

If the context file doesn't exist, run the `developer-audience-context` skill first.

| **Discourse** | Long-form, searchable | SEO, threading, ownership | Maintenance, hosting costs |
| **Circle** | Courses, paid communities | Courses integration, clean | Paid, less developer-native |

### Decision Framework

## Handling Toxicity

### Code of Conduct Essentials

```markdown
# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

**Do:**
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn (no "RTFM")
- Assume good intentions
- Give constructive feedback
- Report problems, don't engage

**Don't:**
- Personal attacks or harassment
- Discrimination of any kind
- Spam or self-promotion
- NSFW content
- Doxxing or privacy violations
- Bad faith arguments

## Enforcement

1. **Warning** — First offense, good faith
2. **Temp mute** — Repeated issues
3. **Temp ban** — Serious violations
4. **Permanent ban** — Egregious or repeated

## Reporting

DM any @moderator or use the report feature.
All reports are confidential.
```

### Moderation Playbook

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Heated debate** | "Let's keep this constructive. Both perspectives have merit." |
| **Help vampire** | "Here's a guide on asking good questions: [link]" |
| **Self-promotion spam** | Delete, warn, or ban depending on frequency |
| **Off-topic drift** | "Great discussion! Let's move this to #off-topic" |
| **Harassment** | Immediate mute, investigate, likely ban |
| **Bad faith troll** | Don't engage publicly, ban quietly |

### De-escalation Techniques

1. **Acknowledge feelings** — "I can see this is frustrating"
2. **Move to DM** — "Let's continue this privately"
3. **Take a break** — "Let's pause and revisit tomorrow"
4. **Clarify intent** — "I think there might be a misunderstanding"
5. **Set boundaries** — "We're here to help, but not to be yelled at"

### Moderator Self-Care

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Burnout | Rotate moderator duties |
| Taking it personally | Remember: it's not about you |
| Imposter syndrome | Regular team check-ins |
| Isolation | Moderator private channel |
