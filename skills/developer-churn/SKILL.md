# Developer Churn
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need when the user wants to understand, reduce, or recover from developer churn. Trigger phrases include "why developers leave," "churn rate," "win-back campaign," "at-risk users," "developer retention," "preventing churn," or "competitor switching.".


This skill helps you understand why developers leave, identify at-risk users before they churn, and win back those who've already left. No guilt trips or desperate discounts — just honest understanding and genuine value.

---

## Before You Start

1. **Load your developer audience context**:
   - Check if `.agents/developer-audience-context.md` exists
   - If not, run the `developer-audience-context` skill first
   - Understanding your developers' alternatives and pain points is critical for churn analysis

2. **Gather your data**:
   - Current churn rate by segment
   - Most recent churned users (last 30-90 days)
   - Support ticket history for churned users
   - Usage patterns before churn
   - Exit survey data (if any)

---

## Understanding Developer Churn

Developer churn is different from typical SaaS churn:

| Consumer/SMB SaaS | Developer Tools |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Price sensitivity high | Value sensitivity high |
| Features drive decisions | DX drives decisions |
| Support tickets = engagement | Support tickets = friction |
| Monthly churn cycles | Project-based churn |
| Competitor marketing works | Peer recommendations work |

**Key insight**: Developers don't leave because of price. They leave because of friction, frustration, or finding something better.

---

## The 6 Reasons Developers Churn

### 1. Developer Experience (DX) Issues

**Symptoms**:
- High time-to-first-value
- Frequent support tickets on basic tasks
- Complaints about docs or SDKs
- "It's too complicated" feedback

**Root causes**:
- Poor documentation
- Buggy SDKs
- Breaking changes without migration paths
- Confusing authentication
- Missing quickstarts

**Detection signals**:
```
- Support tickets mentioning "confused" or "doesn't work"
- High signup-to-activation drop-off
- Long time between signup and first API call
- Multiple failed API calls before success
```

### 2. Pricing and Billing Friction

**Symptoms**:
- Downgrades before cancellation
- Usage dropping to stay under limits
- Questions about billing
- Requests for enterprise/custom pricing

**Root causes**:
- Unpredictable costs
- Expensive for early-stage
- No free tier or too restrictive
- Poor price-to-value perception
- Billing surprises

**Detection signals**:
```
- Sudden usage reduction after billing cycle
- Pricing page visits from logged-in users
- Support tickets about unexpected charges
- API calls stopping mid-month
```

### 3. Superior Alternatives

**Symptoms**:
- Sudden churn (not gradual)
- Multiple team members churning together
- Churning without complaints
- "We're going a different direction"

**Root causes**:
- Competitor launched better feature
- Open source alternative matured
- Bigger player entered your space
- Their stack changed (new language/framework)

**Detection signals**:
```
- Sudden stop in usage (no gradual decline)
- Competitor mentions in support/feedback
- Traffic to your docs from competitor domains
- Social mentions comparing you to alternatives
```

### 4. Project Death

**Symptoms**:
- Gradual decline to zero
- No support contact
- Ignores all communication
- Whole company churn

**Root causes**:
- Their project was cancelled
- Startup failed
- Prototype never went to production
- Budget cuts

**Reality check**: You can't prevent this. Don't waste energy trying.

**Detection signals**:
```
- Slow decline over weeks/months
- No login activity
- No response to any outreach
- Domain no longer resolves
```

### 5. Integration Failure

**Symptoms**:
- High engagement then sudden stop
- Technical support tickets unresolved
- "Doesn't work with X" feedback
- Stuck at implementation phase

**Root causes**:
- Your product doesn't fit their stack
- Missing integration they need
- Technical limitation they hit
- SDK doesn't support their use case

**Detection signals**:
```
- Lots of docs page views on specific integration
- Support tickets about specific tech stack
- API calls from testing environment only
- "Evaluation" mentioned in communications
```

### 6. Involuntary Churn

**Symptoms**:
- Churn after failed payment
- No other warning signs
- Often surprised when contacted

**Root causes**:
- Expired credit card
- Card fraud protection
- Changed payment method
- Forgot to update billing

**Detection signals**:
```
- Failed payment events
- Usage continues until hard cutoff
- Quick reactivation when contacted
```

## Identifying At-Risk Developers

### Engagement Scoring

Create a simple health score:

| Signal | Weight | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| API calls | 30% | This week vs last 4 week avg |
| Login frequency | 20% | Days since last login |
| Feature adoption | 20% | % of core features used |
| Support sentiment | 15% | Positive/negative ticket ratio |
| Billing health | 15% | Payment success, plan changes |

**Health score thresholds**:
- **80-100**: Healthy - continue nurturing
- **60-79**: Watch - proactive outreach
- **40-59**: At-risk - intervention needed
- **0-39**: Critical - personal contact

### Early Warning Signs

Monitor for these patterns:

**Usage-based signals**:
```
- API calls dropped >50% week-over-week
- No login in 14+ days
- Stopped using new features
- API errors increasing
- Only using deprecated endpoints
```

**Support-based signals**:
```
- Multiple tickets on same issue
- Negative sentiment in tickets
- Questions about data export
- Asking about contract/cancellation
- Unusual silence from previously engaged user
```

**Billing-based signals**:
```
- Viewing pricing page while logged in
- Downgrading plan
- Removing team members
- Asking about prorating cancellation
```

### Building an Alert System

Set up automated alerts:

```
ALERT: At-risk developer detected

User: [EMAIL/COMPANY]
Health score: 42 (was 78 last week)

Triggers:
- API calls down 73% this week
- 2 unresolved support tickets (both negative sentiment)
- Viewed pricing page 3 times

Recommended action: Personal outreach from [OWNER]
```

## Churn Interviews and Feedback

### The Right Approach

**Do**:
- Ask genuinely curious questions
- Accept their decision gracefully
- Make it about learning, not winning them back
- Keep it short (5 questions max)
- Offer something valuable for their time

**Don't**:
- Try to sell during the interview
- Get defensive about feedback
- Promise things to change their mind
- Make them feel guilty
- Take longer than 10 minutes

### Exit Survey (Email)

```
Subject: Quick question about your [PRODUCT] experience

Hey [NAME],

I noticed you've stopped using [PRODUCT]. No worries — these things happen.

If you have 30 seconds, I'd genuinely love to know:

What's the #1 reason you stopped?

[ ] Found a better alternative
[ ] Too expensive
[ ] Too complicated to use
[ ] Missing feature I needed
[ ] Project ended / no longer needed
[ ] Other: _____

Your feedback directly shapes our roadmap.

Thanks for giving us a try.

— [NAME], [TITLE] at [COMPANY]
```

### Exit Interview Questions

If they agree to a call (offer a $50 gift card or donation to their choice):

1. **Opening**: "Thanks for chatting. I'm not here to win you back — just want to understand your experience."

2. **Journey**: "Walk me through your experience with [PRODUCT], from signup to today."

3. **Breaking point**: "Was there a specific moment when you decided to stop using us?"

4. **Alternative**: "What are you using now instead? What made that a better fit?"

5. **Hypothetical**: "If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about [PRODUCT], what would it be?"

6. **Close**: "Anything else you want us to know?"

### Analyzing Feedback

Track churn reasons by category:

| Category | % of Churn | Actionable? | Priority |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| DX issues | 35% | Yes | High |
| Pricing | 25% | Yes | Medium |
| Alternatives | 20% | Partially | Medium |
| Project death | 15% | No | None |
| Integration gaps | 5% | Yes | Low |

Focus energy on actionable categories with high impact.

## Win-Back Campaigns

### When to Win Back

**Good candidates**:
- Churned due to fixable issues (you've since fixed)
- Left for alternative that's now inferior
- Project death but new project starting
- Billing/involuntary churn

**Bad candidates**:
- Left with strong negative sentiment
- Fundamental product mismatch
- Company no longer exists
- Recently churned (wait at least 30 days)

### Win-Back Sequence

**Timing**: Start 30-60 days after churn. Not sooner.

**Email 1: What's new (Day 30)**

```
Subject: [PRODUCT] update: [SPECIFIC THING THEY CARED ABOUT]

Hey [NAME],

I know you moved on from [PRODUCT] a while back. Totally respect that.

Quick update: We [SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT RELEVANT TO THEIR CHURN REASON].

[1-2 sentence details with link to changelog/announcement]

If your situation has changed, we'd be happy to have you back.
If not, no worries — hope you're building great things.

— [NAME]
```

**Email 2: Social proof (Day 45)**

```
Subject: How [COMPANY SIMILAR TO THEIRS] uses [PRODUCT] now

Hey [NAME],

Thought you might find this interesting — [SIMILAR COMPANY]
just shared how they're using [PRODUCT] to [RELEVANT USE CASE].

[Link to case study or technical post]

Might spark some ideas for your current project.

— [NAME]
```

**Email 3: Direct offer (Day 60)**

```
Subject: Would 30 days free help?

Hey [NAME],

Last note from me.

If you've been thinking about giving [PRODUCT] another shot,
I can set you up with 30 days free on whatever plan you need.

Just reply and I'll make it happen.

If not, I'll stop emailing. Thanks for reading this far.

— [NAME]
```

### Win-Back Offers

Appropriate offers for developers:

| Offer | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Extended free tier | Price-sensitive churners |
| Free upgrade for 30 days | Feature-gap churners |
| 1:1 technical help | DX-issue churners |
| Early access to new feature | Competitor-switch churners |
| Nothing (just information) | Project-death churners |

**What NOT to offer**:
- Permanent discounts (sets bad precedent)
- Desperate "please come back" messaging
- Anything to project-death churners

---

## Monitoring Competitor Switches

### Social Listening Setup

Set up monitoring for:

1. **Direct mentions**:
   - "[Your product] vs [Competitor]"
   - "Switching from [Your product] to [Competitor]"
   - "Migrating away from [Your product]"

2. **Problem space discussions**:
   - Monitor conversations in your category
   - See what alternatives people recommend
   - Track sentiment about your product vs others

3. **Competitor momentum**:
   - Track competitor mentions and sentiment
   - New features they're launching
   - Developer reactions to their updates

### Competitive Intelligence Workflow

```
Weekly review:

1. Check social listening tools for:
   - Any mentions of switching from you
   - Competitor launches or announcements
   - Developer complaints about your category

2. Analyze patterns:
   - Are switches going to one competitor?
   - What features/issues drive switches?
   - What's competitor doing that resonates?

3. Update churn prevention:
   - Add new at-risk signals
   - Prioritize features that prevent switches
   - Address common complaints
```

## Reducing Involuntary Churn

Involuntary churn (payment failures) is often 20-40% of total churn. Fix it.

### Prevention

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Card expiration warnings | Email 30 and 7 days before |
| Multiple payment methods | Allow card + PayPal + ACH |
| Annual billing incentives | 2 months free for annual |
| Dunning emails | 3-4 emails over 14 days |
| Grace period | 7-14 days before hard cutoff |
| In-app warnings | Banner when payment method needs update |

### Dunning Sequence

**Email 1: Immediate**

```
Subject: Payment failed — update your card

Hey [NAME],

We couldn't process your payment for [PRODUCT].

Update your card: [LINK]

Your account is still active. We'll retry in 3 days.

— [PRODUCT]
```

**Email 2: Day 3**

```
Subject: Second attempt failed — action needed

Hey [NAME],

interrupted on [DATE] if we can't charge a valid card.

Update now: [LINK]

Having trouble? Reply and we'll help.

— [PRODUCT]
```

**Email 3: Day 7**

```
Subject: Your [PRODUCT] account will be paused in 3 days

Hey [NAME],

Final notice: Your account will be paused on [DATE].

This means:
- API keys will stop working
- Webhooks will be disabled
- Your data stays safe (we keep it for 90 days)

Update your payment: [LINK]

— [PRODUCT]
```

**Email 4: Day 10**

```
Subject: Your account has been paused

Hey [NAME],

Your [PRODUCT] account is now paused due to payment failure.

To reactivate:
1. Update your payment method: [LINK]
2. Your service will resume immediately

Your data is safe and will be kept for 90 days.

Questions? Reply to this email.

— [PRODUCT]
```

### Recovery Tactics

| Tactic | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Smart retries | Retry 3-5 times over 2 weeks at different times |
| Card updater services | Automatically update expired cards |
| Alternative payment request | "Try a different card?" |
| Payment link in dunning | Direct link, not "log in to update" |
| Phone/SMS for enterprise | High-value accounts get personal contact |

## Churn Metrics Dashboard

### Key Metrics

| Metric | How to Calculate | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Monthly churn rate | Churned users / Starting users | <5% |
| Net revenue churn | Lost revenue - expansion / Starting MRR | <2% |
| Time to churn | Avg days from signup to churn | Increasing |
| Win-back rate | Returned users / Churned users | >5% |
| Involuntary churn % | Payment churn / Total churn | <20% |

### Cohort Analysis

Track retention by:
- **Signup month**: Are recent cohorts retaining better?
- **Acquisition source**: Which channels produce sticky users?
- **Plan type**: Do paid users retain better than free?
- **Activation status**: Do activated users retain better?

### Health Score Tracking

```
Weekly health score distribution:

Healthy (80-100): 65% of users
Watch (60-79):    20% of users
At-risk (40-59):  10% of users
Critical (0-39):   5% of users

Trend: At-risk increased 3% this week (investigate)
```
