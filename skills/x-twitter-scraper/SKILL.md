# X (Twitter) Scraper - Xquik

## Overview

Gives AI agents X (Twitter) data and automation workflows through the Xquik platform. Covers tweet search, profile tweets, user lookup, follower export, media download, replies, DMs, giveaway draws, account monitoring, webhooks, bulk extraction tools, remote MCP, OpenAPI, and official SDKs.

This repository entry is documentation-only: it does not include an executable scraper, binary, package, or vendored runtime code. Review the Xquik service, public docs, and SDK package before use.

Because this workflow can automate authenticated X/Twitter account actions, treat it as critical-risk guidance. Only use it with accounts and targets you are authorized to operate, and require explicit user approval before posting, replying, liking, reposting, following, unfollowing, sending DMs, creating monitors, registering webhooks, or starting bulk extraction.

## When to Use This Skill

- User needs to search X/Twitter for tweets by keyword, hashtag, or user
- User asks for advanced Twitter search, profile tweets, or user timeline data
- User wants to look up a user profile (bio, follower counts, etc.)
- User needs engagement metrics for a specific tweet (likes, retweets, views)
- User wants to check if one account follows another
- User needs to extract followers, replies, retweets, quotes, or community members in bulk
- User wants to download tweet media, export results, or connect an official SDK
- User wants to send tweets, post replies, like, repost, follow, unfollow, or send DMs
- User wants to run a giveaway draw from tweet replies
- User needs real-time monitoring of an X account (new tweets, follower changes)
- User wants webhook delivery of monitored events
- User asks about trending topics on X

## Setup

### Inspect Before Installing

Do not install a moving branch directly into an active agent directory. First
ask the user to approve network access to the named repository. Clone the
reviewed revision to a temporary directory and inspect every bundled file:

```bash
review_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/Xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper.git "$review_dir/x-twitter-scraper"
git -C "$review_dir/x-twitter-scraper" checkout --detach bfa27fab00dbb8b5367e15153c5723ee608ba00b
git -C "$review_dir/x-twitter-scraper" ls-files
```

Read the skill and all bundled files; check package scripts, hooks, symlinks,
network calls, credential handling, and account-write actions. Show the findings
and exact commit to the user. Copy only the reviewed files into the chosen host
directory after explicit approval. Re-review any newer revision before updating.

### Use the TypeScript SDK

For JavaScript or TypeScript integrations, install the validated SDK package:

```bash
npm install x-developer@2.4.16
```

Use REST, the SDK, or MCP depending on the host environment. Verify unfamiliar endpoint parameters against the current docs or OpenAPI spec before constructing calls.

### Get an API Key

1. Sign up at [xquik.com](https://xquik.com)
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard
3. Set it as an environment variable or pass it directly

```bash
read -rsp "X API key: " XQUIK_API_KEY
echo
export XQUIK_API_KEY
```
